<p>My philosophy is that I want to be able to try and learn as many new things as possible. This has lead me down many paths and experiences that have shaped who I am today. These are some of the ways I have gotten involved on campus and some of my favorite past times to escape the ongoing grind of life.</p>

    <h2>IEEE-Computer Society at USF Graphic Design Chair</h2>
        <p>I originally started as the Social Media Chair before transitioning to Graphic Design Chair, where I was responsible for creating promotional materials and managing the society's visual identity. I made a mascot for the club named Nybbles (pictured below), which grew the club's popularity. My stickers designs have become fan favorites since then and many people show up to events just to get the new sticker drop.</p>

    <h2>Lil' Muddies Fun Bunch President</h2>
        <p>I joined Lil' Muddies Fun Bunch, a ceramics club on campus, where I taught myself how to throw on a pottery wheel. I later went on to become an officer and eventually president. I ran studio sessions and coordinated for other officers to manage studio sessions as well, so that we could provide USF students with free access to an artistic outlet.</p>

    <h2>Physical Activities</h2>
    <div class = "hr-1"></div>

    <h3>Bouldering</h3>
    <p>I began climbing January 2025 when USF opened their rock wall. The hardest climb I've ever done was a V5, but I typically can do climbs at a V3-V4 level. During my internship, I took a new person to Movement Mountain View (my favoritie rock climbing gym) every week, so I could introduce other interns to climbing.</p>

    <h3>Drawing/Painting</h3>
    <p>I have always enjoyed drawing and painting as a way to relax and express myself. I mainly use digital mediums such as Procreate for graphic design, but I also enjoy traditional mediums such as watercolor and acrylics.</p>

    <h3>Sewing/Knitting</h3>
    <p>For my junior prom in high school, I decided to learn how to sew so that I could 
        make my own dress. Later in college, I saw a post on Instagram promoting a knitting 
        tutorial for a cute little cat ear beanie. My friend taught me how to knit using two pencils 
        and free yarn I had gotten from an event, and I continued to learn on my own from there.</p>
